# Uber-Ride-Cancellation-Predictor
The goal of this project is to build a model that can predict whether a new ride booking will be cancelled before it even happens. This is a critical task for a company like Uber, as it helps them manage their driver supply, improve efficiency, and enhance customer experience.
